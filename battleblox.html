									</h2>
									<p>Battle Blox is the second game I am making and is currently still in development. The hope for this game is to create a fast paced high intensity game while also having a low barrier to entry by making the gameplay loop easy to understand but also having a high skill ceiling for more competitive players. Players will have the ability to create and customize their own loadouts. This will give them the option of which weapon to use and also a special ability to suprise their enemy with. Players will face off on small to medium sized maps in a round based competition. Players will have the option to go head to head in a one on one match or choose to play with teamates up to a five versus five match. As players win matches, they will unlock more weapons and abilities giving them a chance to show their experience and skill.</p>

											<h3>Weapons</h3>
											<p>The goal of battleblox is to have a variety of weapons for players to choose from. From primary weaopns like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles to secondary weapons such as handungs, knives, and other special weapons, players will have the ability to choose the weapons that work best for them.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
											<p>When I set out to make Battle Blocks I wanted something to set it apart from other FPS games. All players will be able to choose a special ability for their loadout. This will provide them with a unique device with two functions. The first function is a siphon which will allow the player to suck up destructable parts of the map and charge up their special ability. Once the ability is charged up fully, the player will have access to launch a powerful special ability that will give them a big advantage against their opponent.</p>

											<p>All players will be fit with a siphon. The siphon allows players to take advantage of the destructive parts of the map. When a player siphons blocks into their device, the player will gain energy towards their special ability. Once the player has a full energy bar, the player will have access to their special ability. The special abilities provide a heavy advantage to the player and are designed to change the tides of the match. However, be cautious, the other player will also have access to a special ability of their choosing! </p>

												<p>Each weapon and special ability device will have its own animations and mechanics. This provides the player with an engaging experience and provides the player with the option to choose the setup with the right 'feel'. The goal of Battle Blox will be to have a catalog of various weapons providing the player with many different options and combinations to find the right blend to give them the edge over their opponent.</p>

											<p>All models and animations are created using Blender. I believe having unique models and animations created from scratch provides a unique and authentic experience for the player. All models are created keeping in mind sound topology practices to provide an efficient gameplay experience with minimal lag but not at the expense of appearance. Animations are created with purposeful constraints and realistic movements to give the player a higher sense of engagement with their character.</p>
